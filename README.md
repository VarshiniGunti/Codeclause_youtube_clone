This is a simple HTML and CSS project for a video sharing website, similar to YouTube. It includes a homepage and a video playback page, as well as a responsive sidebar menu. Below, you'll find a brief overview of the project structure and how to use it.

Project Structure

index.html: This is the homepage of the video sharing website. It includes a navigation bar, a sidebar menu, a featured video carousel, and a list of video thumbnails.
play-video.html: This is the video playback page. It includes a video player, video tags, video title, video views and upload date, like/dislike buttons, a description, and a comments section.
style.css: This CSS file contains the styles for both HTML files, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design.

Responsive Design: The website is designed to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes, including mobile devices.
Navigation: The navigation bar at the top of the page includes links to important sections of the website, such as Home, Explore, Subscriptions, Library, History, Playlist, Messages, and more.
Sidebar Menu: The sidebar menu on the left provides quick access to various sections and features of the website, including shortcuts, subscriptions, and more. It can be toggled to a smaller size by clicking on the menu icon.
Video Playback Page: The "play-video.html" page allows users to watch videos, view video details, like/dislike videos, share videos, save videos, and leave comments.

You can customize this project by:

Replacing the placeholder images and video with your own media content.
Modifying the text and descriptions to match your video titles and descriptions.
Adding your own CSS styles to change the visual design of the website.
Extending the functionality with JavaScript to add features like user authentication, video recommendations, or a video upload system.
